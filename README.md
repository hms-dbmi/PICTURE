Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Differentiates Cancers of the Central Nervous System – A Multi-Center Study.
#### Abstract

Accurate pathological diagnosis is crucial in guiding optimal and personalized treatments for patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancers. Distinguishing several common types of CNS tumors, such as glioblastoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), can be particularly challenging due to their overlapping histopathology features. Because these cancers require different treatments, fast and accurate pathological evaluation will improve patients’ clinical outcomes. To address this clinical challenge, we collected digital images of 2,803 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 1,371 frozen section slides from multiple hospitals worldwide. Leveraging a diagnosis-agnostic foundation model, diverse pathology images from the literature, and uncertainty quantification, we developed the Pathology Image Characterization Tool with Uncertainty-aware Rapid Evaluation (PICTURE).
