Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Differentiates Cancers of the Central Nervous System â€“ A Multi-Center Study
#### Abstract

Pathology evaluation is crucial for diagnosing cancers in the central nervous system (CNS) and identifying the optimal treatments. Distinguishing glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is particularly challenging even for specialists, due to the wide variations of their pathology manifestations and overlapping features. To address this challenge, we collected 1919 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 1342 cryosections slides from multiple hospitals and study cohorts worldwide. Leveraging a diagnosis-agnostic foundation model, diverse pathology images from the literature, and uncertainty quantification, we developed the Pathology Imaging Characterization with Uncertainty-aware Rapid Evaluation (PICTURE) system. Our approaches provide a generalizable approach for differentiating pathological mimics and enable rapid and accurate diagnostics for CNS cancers.
